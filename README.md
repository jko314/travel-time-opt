# Technician and Material Placement

Problem Statement: 
Estimating the costs and expected performance involves estimating the cost and time spent traveling to the asset, the 
time spent repairing the asset, and the cost and time spent returning from the repair, the cost of parts used, etc.
In the past at Leidos, each team working on a problem like this has developed ad hoc approaches and tools for making 
these estimates. This results in duplicated effort and less consistent and accurate estimates, as lessons learned in 
previous estimation activities are not passed on to improve future estimates

Goal:The Technician and Material Placement (TaMP) IRAD is focused on developing guidance and tools to help estimate 
costs and performance associated with maintaining geographically distributed assets. This document is the Concept 
document for this IRAD, which defines the overall goals and objectives of the IRAD and the general approach for 
achieving those goals and objectives.
